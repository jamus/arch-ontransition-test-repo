# Arch - Hierarchical State Machine Library for Roblox

## Overview

Arch is an open-source hierarchical state machine (HSM) library designed specifically for Roblox developers. Leveraging the principles of hierarchical state machines, Arch provides a structured and efficient framework for managing states within Roblox projects. With a focus on precise control, adaptability, and seamless transitions, Arch empowers developers to model and manage complex game logic efficiently.

## Features

- **Hierarchical State Management:** Arch enables the creation of a structured system where states can be organized hierarchically, offering a clear and intuitive way to represent complex game behaviors.

- **Seamless Transitions:** States seamlessly transition between each other, providing precise control over the flow of game logic. This feature is particularly valuable in scenarios such as combat systems, dynamic interfaces, and diverse game scenarios.

- **Versatile Toolkit:** Arch equips developers with a versatile toolkit for creating responsive and engaging gameplay experiences. Whether you're crafting combat systems, dynamic interfaces, or intricate game scenarios, Arch provides the flexibility needed to meet diverse requirements.

- **Conflict Resolution:** Arch includes robust conflict resolution mechanisms, ensuring smooth handling of complex scenarios within your game. This feature enhances the reliability and stability of your project.
